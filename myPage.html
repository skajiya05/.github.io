<h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Shota Kajiya. I am a Colorado native who loves sports and spending time outside in the beautiful Colorado mountains. I grew up in Denver where my parents moved to from Japan, making me and my brother first generation Japanese-Americans. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science with a minor in Innovation and Leadership from the Leeds School of Business. In the Summer of 2020, I completed an internship at Speectrum Telecommunications as the Accessbility Learning Business Analyst. There, I utilized Excel in order to collect and interpret mass amounts of data, while interpreting and analyzing to maximize efficiency within the Accessibility department and their products. I also takes pride in my community service work as I completed a philanthropic event called Journey of Hope in the Summer of 2019. For this event, I rode my bicycle 3,835 miles from Santa Barbara, CA to Washington D.C. in order to raise money and awareness for people with disabilities, both physical and mental.</p>

<h4>Portfolio</h4>
<p>Here is a link to my personal website containing my portfolio, including some of my work I have completed in school and from my internship at Spectrum.
