<h1 style="text-align:center">$GME Stock</h1>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In the last week of January of 2021, an unusual occurrence took place within the stock market regarding the stock of Gamestop. The highly debated question is the ethics of using social media platforms to engage in a collective action where the "giants" of the stock world are at a loss. In this instance, Reddit was the platform used to gather a great amount of middle class people to come together to act against the hedge funds who had been shorting $GME. The collective action on a free to use website is justifiable because anyone can resoursefully use this information, including lower, middle class people and the hedge fund companies. This occurrence brings an intriguing case for data scientists because it shows the power of online communities. </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Data scientists should be researching the how of this impactful online community who can, collectively, face the hedge fund companies. They should view the history of the subreddit page WallStreetBets and how it became so popular. The emergence of a union built of redditors who were all committed to the same action. The internet is full of fake news and scams, so how did these people listen to a lead voice and commit their hard earned money. This was never possible if the people within had not taken it seriously enough and acted as one. The research of finding how this happened is ultimately to find what kind of actions online communities can do next.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Stock brokers and hedge funds are very vulnerable to short squeezes and can ultimately bankrupt them, creating a need for regulations. A short squeeze occurs when a stock jumps or increases extremely sharply. Traders, usually the hedge funds, who had bet that the price of that stock would fall w0ould be at great risk of losing money and forcing them to buy the stock in order to cut their losses. When an online community such as r/WallStreetBets is present, these companies can go completely bankrupt, causing a need of regulations. </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The question within this instance is what regulations can be created or even if they should be created. I believe platforms such as reddit that has uncensored free speech should not be regulated. Free speech in online communities is a completely legal use of the internet, but when it starts to bankrupt companies and break the stock market, the belief for a regulation comes in play. The crucial point is that the stock market must be maintained, but I believe there aren't any regulations the SEC, security and exchange commision, could and will do. Traders can trade however they want and creating regulations is illegal. Robinhood, a stock trading and investing application, decided to close all buying of stocks that were seeing an incredible spike of increase due to WallStreetBets. This action by Robinhood was very illegal because it restricted traders and told them what they could and couldn't buy.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; So, what is next? I believe there won't be any regulations put in place for anything, but an extreme spike in a stock where hedge funds lose this much money won't happen again. Hedge funds will stop shorting these at such an extreme rate. The presence of online communities with a mass population that can act together immediately will alter the decisions hedge funds make when shorting these stocks. The other essential problem of this entire situation is Robinhood's action in the midst of this. Robinhood is a broker, therefore obligated to put their clients interests first and provide them with best execution. Best execution is the idea that brokers must give their clients the absolute best price or fastest execution, proving them the best service possible. They failed to do so when they stopped allowing traders to buy more stocks of certain companies that were acted upon by WallStreetBets such as Gamestop.</p>
